The protocols native governance token is UNI, allowing holders to propose and vote on changes made to the Uniswap protocol.

## Sushiswap

Sushiswap is a decentralized exchange protocol. While originally launching as a Uniswap fork, the project's community has since developed a wide range of features that make use of decentralized liquidity pools. The Kasi suite of the protocol allows people to lend and borrow tokens as well as to trade with leverage in a decentralized way, for example. The protocols native token, SUSHI, can be staked in order to claim a part of the protocol's fees.

## Yearn

Yearn finance is a protocol of DeFi protocols, in a way. People can deposit their tokens into yearn's vaults to earn yield on their crypto assets in various ways. The protocol employs numerous strategies to find the best opportunities the DeFi market presents across various lending- and trading platforms. YFI is the governance token for the Yearn Finance protocol. It can be used to vote and receive cash flows from the fees earned by the protocol.

## Balancer

The protocol's native token is BAL, used for governing the protocol's development by the community.

## Synthetix

Synthetix is a decentralized synthetic asset issuance protocol. It allows people to stake its native token, SNX, over periods of time, in exchange of synthetic assets, which may reflect fiat (or crypto-) currencies, commodities, and other sorts of financial assets.

## Lido

Lido is a decentralized protocol that lets people provide their Ethereum so that the collective liquidity may be used for ETH 2.0 staking. They receive stETH tokens on a 1:1 basis which may be used for lending and other on-chain activities on the current Ethereum network, with the exception that the stETH tokens are innately interest bearing, and are updated daily to reflect the owners' staking rewards.

``## Bancor

Bancor is a decentralized exchange. It is distinguished from other DEX protocols by its automated market maker, which lets people deposit liquidity in a single-sided fashion, whereas many other platforms require its visitors to provide liquidity with their tokens in an inherently two-sided way. Bancor's automated market maker mechanism achieves this through its native token, BNT, which is dynamically minted and co-invested by the protocol when visitors deposit their collateral as liquidity. Besides having BNT as the unitary counterpart asset of exchange for trading on the platform, the protocol also offers a unique solution against Impermanent Loss to its liquidity providers.

## Alchemix

Alchemix Finance is a DeFi protocol that allows people to create yield-backed synthetic tokens in exchange for providing their cryptocurrencies as collateral. Visitors can for example deposit their DAI into the protocol, and receive (a lesser amount of) alUSD tokens, equally pegged to $1. The protocol uses the collateral provided by its visitors to collect yield and dynamically repay the depositors' debt, essentially giving its users an immediate claim on the future yield of their tokens. The protocols native token is ALCX, used to govern the development and directional decisions of Alchemix.
