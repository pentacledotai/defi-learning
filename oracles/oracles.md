Data Sources are defined here as passive entities that store and measure the representation of the ground truth. Common types of data sources include 
 - databases 
 - sensors
 - humans
 - smart contracts
 - or a combination of them

  Depending on how data sources gather and retrieve the ground truth, and where a representation of that value relies upon, there can be different attack types.
