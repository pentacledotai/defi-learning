## What is it?

Insurance is a way for people to protect themselves from
potential risks. You buy an insurance from an insurance
company for some fee, and if an accident occurs, the
company compensates you.

Insurance companies are essentially a way for people to
socialise their risks by pooling their money together.

In DeFi, just as there are decentralised protocols built
for people to lend out and/or exchange their tokens, there
are insurance protocols where one can buy insurance against
accidents on the blockchain â€” or put their funds in the
insurance pools to cover others from losses in exchange for
rewards.
