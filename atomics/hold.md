## What is it?

Starting with Bitcoin, cryptocurrencies have introduced a truly novel form of money (and more) to the world. The thing which unites and makes this asset class special is the technology referred to as **blockchain**; a set of algorithms and rules that constitute a distributed digital network where each participant (e.g. holder of a cryptocurrency) can be sure that their balances are correct and accessible.

Ethereum, the second biggest cryptocurrecy today, proved that blockchains are useful for more than just simple money transfers; it allows people to build decentralized apps, which, in less than a decade, has resulted in an explosion of Decentralized Financial (DeFi) protocols, and tokens of all kind, including NFTs.

There are thousands of cryptocurrencies today with many created each day — it is important to understand the purpose and background of a token before buying it.

## Why would I?

Need for transmission fees…
Stablecoins; accessibility / convenience crossborder / better savings options
NFTs? Nice to look at

## Risk implications

Natural volatility
Code bugs/exploits (unintended)
Scam coins / rugpulls

## Rewards

...
Speculate it goes up; store of value

Goes together with the why kinda?
