## What is it?

Starting with Bitcoin, cryptocurrencies have introduced a truly novel form of money (and more) to the world. The thing which unites and makes this asset class special is the technology referred to as **blockchain**; a set of algorithms and rules that constitute a distributed digital network where each participant (e.g. holder of a cryptocurrency) can be sure that their balances are correct and accessible — without trusting a central intermediary, like a bank.

Ethereum, the second biggest cryptocurrecy today, proved that blockchains are useful for more than just simple money transfers; it allows people to build decentralized apps, which, in less than a decade, has resulted in an explosion of Decentralized Financial (DeFi) protocols, and tokens of all kind, including NFTs.

There are thousands of cryptocurrencies today with many created each day — it is important to understand the purpose and background of a token before buying it.

## Why would I?

Bitcoin is the first trustless internet-native currency. Since its blockchain ledger is distributed and open, anyone is free to use it, as well as able to verify that its rules are maintained and noone is spending more than they ought to be able. This is different from "regular" online money transactions, made with e.g. Visa or PayPal, where the service provider can potentially shut you out if they feel like it, or are told to by a government.

## Risk implications

Natural volatility
Code bugs/exploits (unintended)
Scam coins / rugpulls

## Rewards

...
Speculate it goes up; store of value

Goes together with the why kinda?
