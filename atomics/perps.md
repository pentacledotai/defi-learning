## What is it?

Perpetual futures, also known as perpetual swaps or just perps for short,
are a financial derivative derivative. First popularised by BitMex,
they are a a staple of crypto markets today and available in some form
on various Centralised and Decentralised exchanges for hundreds of cryptocurrencies.

A futures contract is an agreement to buy (or sell) a cryptocurrency
at some time in the future. "Traditional" futures have a set expiry date â€”
perpetual futures, on the other hand, have funding payments paid out in regular intervals
to holders of the contracts, keeping their price bound to the underlying coins'.

## Why?

Perpetual futures allow people to speculate on the price of a cryptocurrencies
without the technical burdens and risks that come with purchasing the actual
coin.

Perpetual futures products in crypto notoriously allow people high amounts of leverage.

Speculators can bet against they do not own by short selling their futures contract 
(or hedge their exposure to coins they do own...)
