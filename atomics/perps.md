## What is it?

Perpetual futures, also known as perpetual swaps or just perps for short, are a financial derivative.

A futures contract is an agreement to buy or sell a cryptocurrency at some time in the future. Traditional futures have
a set expiry date â€” perpetual futures, on the other hand, have funding payments paid out in regular intervals to holders
of the contracts, keeping their price bound to the underlying coin(s).

First popularised by BitMex, they are a staple of crypto markets today and available in some form on various Centralised
and Decentralised exchanges for hundreds of cryptocurrencies.

## Why?

Perps allow traders to speculate on the price of a cryptocurrency without the technical burdens and risks that come with
purchasing the actual coin, and notoriously offer high amounts of leverage.

Shorting allows speculators to bet that a coin will decrease in value, while longing allows people to bet a coin will
increase in value over time.

## Rewards

Leverage trading offers people the chance to make significant gains.

## Risk implications

Typical risks associated with leverage include magnified losses and potential liquidation.
