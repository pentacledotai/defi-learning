## What is it?

Perpetual futures, also known as perpetual swaps or just perps for short, are a financial derivative. First popularised
by BitMex, they are a staple of crypto markets today and available in some form on various Centralised and Decentralised
exchanges for hundreds of cryptocurrencies.

A futures contract is an agreement to buy or sell a cryptocurrency at some time in the future. Traditional futures have
a set expiry date â€” perpetual futures, on the other hand, have funding payments paid out in regular intervals to holders
of the contracts, keeping their price bound to the underlying coin(s).

## Why?

Perpetual futures allow people to speculate on the price of a cryptocurrencies without the technical burdens and risks
that come with purchasing the actual coin.

Perpetual futures products in crypto notoriously allow people high amounts of leverage.

Shorting allows speculators to bet that a coin will decrease in value, while longing allows people to bet a coin will
increase in value.

## Rewards

Leverage trading offers people the chance to make higher gains than if they were holding a spot position.

## Risk implications

Typical risks associated with leverage: magnified losses, potential liquidation.
