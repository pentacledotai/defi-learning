## What is it?

An option is a financial contract that give its buyer the right,
but not the obligation, to buy or sell an underlying asset for
a specific price on (or possibly before) a specific time.

Ethereum.

There are also several DeFi protocols that allow people to
buy or sell options of smaller cryptocurrencies, as well as
protocols that automatically execute various options strategies
in order to generate yield on people's deposits.
