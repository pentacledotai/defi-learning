## What is it?

The simple acts of Lending and Borrowing are prominent financial primitives that form the basis of
many more complex financial products.

Just as there are DEXes operated by Automated Market Makers that allow people to swap their coins
seamlessly with each other, there are numerous lending applications in DeFi.

lending and borrowing is a financial primitive
as there are Dexes, there are lending platforms in defi, 


## Why?

As a lender, you can provide liquidity (deposit coins to borrow) to the protocol in order to
 - earn interest on your deposits from borrowers
 - take out a loan in the form of some other coin using your deposits as collateral

---

lend tokens to earn interest on the tokens you deposit, sometimes with the added bonus of ponzi tokens

you can take a loan out against your deposit

eg Maker allows ppl to deposit, and then mint dai


## Rewards

Lending protocols in DeFi let people take out loans from each other seamlessly and transparently;
the interest rates and risk parameters are decided by the algorithms coded into the decentralised
applications â€” like a bank or a pawn shop, but friendlier.

DeFi protocols often reward their users (borrowers and lenders both, in this case) with native tokens,
typically used to govern future changes to the protocol. 


## Risk implications

When borrowing coins against deposited collateral, it is important to keep an eye on our health ratio;
if the value of our collateral drops too much in proportion to our loan, the system may forcibly
liquidate our funds lest we deposit more or pay back what we have borrowed.

While the interest rates on deposits and borrows are decided algorithmically in a transparent manner,
they typically are not stable but rather fluctuate depending on supply and demand.

Loss of liquidity
Unpredictable returns as APY is not always fixed
If your collateral drops in value you can get liquidated
Have to keep health-ratio in check and repay your loan or deposit a healthy amount to ensure correct ratios
if there is too little liquidity amongst borrowers of the token you have lent, you may not be able to withdraw your deposit
Depositing with larger protocols is generally less risky
impermanent loss can be a danger in providing liquidity to Dexes if you are
