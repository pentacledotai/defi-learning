## What is it?

Staking crypto essentially means locking it up for future rewards â€” much like a savings account. The complexity of staking one's crypto, as well as the risks and rewards can vary depending on the coin and the place where it is staked.

Bitcoin's blockchain relies on a consensus mechanism called Proof of Work, where the validity of the network is maintained by having people use their computers for solving math problems, roughly speaking. Proof of Stake is an alternative consensus mechanism that aims to alleviate the computational burden from a blockchain network via having people put their coins on the line instead. PoS networks include Solana, Avalanche and ETH2.0, amongst others.

In DeFi applications built on top of these blockchains, staking coins has been used for incentivising people to provide liquidity or partake in governance, for example.


## Why would I?

Depends on the protocol; most often you stake your LP tokens to "prove" that you are committed to providing liquidity, in exchange for yield rewards.

Proof of Stake L1s need it for network security...

Governance

## Risk implications
