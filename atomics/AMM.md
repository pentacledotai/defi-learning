## What is it?

Automated Market Maker
the algorithm that allows Decentralized Exchanges to operate, e.g. xyk (Uniswap), constantswap (curve), etc...


## Why would I?

AMMs are mathetmatical functions that make it possible for people to trade their coins on Decentralized Exchanges (DEX) in a transparent way on the blockchain, without trusted intermediaries.

## Risk implications

Code bugs/exploits (unintended, many new and untested AMM algorithms)
Scam coins / rugpulls â€” the market owner on e.g. coinbase makes sure only "legit" coins are available on their platform; not the case on permissionless DEXes...

## Rewards

Exchange without trusted intermediaries
Sometimes the DEX protocols have their own coin which they give out as a reward to their users (as an airdrop or in form of yield for LPing, for example)
