## What is it?

Traditional digital markets, like the NASDAQ stock exchange (as well as centralized crypto exchanges) work with matching engines built for so-called Limit Order Books: buyers and sellers have to offer up their goods at a certain price in a certain quantity, and wait to be matched with someone else to conduct a trade. 

This may sound simple in principle, but these orderbooks are a very competitive landscape where professional market makers compete with each other at split second speeds — it has been practically impossible to replicate this model on today's decentralized blockchains such as Ethereum.


## Why would I?

Automated Market Makers (AMMs) are mathetmatical functions that make it possible for people to trade their coins on Decentralized Exchanges (DEX) in a transparent way on the blockchain, without trusted intermediaries. Continuing with the comparison, they are a replacement for the matching engine used on traditional marketplaces, while the order books are replaced with so-called Liquidity Pools — kept in balance by the aforementioned AMM.

## Risk implications

Code bugs/exploits (unintended, many new and untested AMM algorithms)
Scam coins / rugpulls — the market owner on e.g. coinbase makes sure only "legit" coins are available on their platform; not the case on permissionless DEXes...

## Rewards

Exchange without trusted intermediaries
Sometimes the DEX protocols have their own coin which they give out as a reward to their users (as an airdrop or in form of yield for LPing, for example)
