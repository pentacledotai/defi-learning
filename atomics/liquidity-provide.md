## What is it?

Liquidity is basically the abundance of a coin in the market. DEXes typically rely on liquidity pools, managed by AMMs, as opposed to the Limit Order Book system prevalent in centralized digital exchanges where professional market makers sell and buy from people with proprietary algorithms.

## Why?

If you create your own coin, you need to have a market for it so people can get it; it's not easy to get listed on a CEX...

A typical technique for creators of coins (or protocols) is to incentivise people to provide liquidity on Decentralised Exchanges for their coins â€“ often referred to as Liquidity Mining. In short, people who provide liquidity (and stake the tokens that prove this) get rewarded by receiving more tokens over time, also known as Yield Farming.

## Risk implications

If the coins' prices change, Divergence Loss can occur.

This is much less likely for LPing various stablecoins, where one can be fairly certain they will stay the same price.
