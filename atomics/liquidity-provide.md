## What is it?

Liquidity is basically the abundance of a coin in a market. DEXes typically rely on liquidity pools, managed by AMMs,
as opposed to the Limit Order Book system prevalent in centralized digital exchanges where professional market makers
sell and buy from people with proprietary algorithms.

## Why?

If you create your own coin, you need to have a market for it so people can trade it, and it's neither cheap or easy to get listed on a
CEX.

A typical technique for creators of coins (or protocols) is to incentivise people to provide liquidity on Decentralised
Exchanges for their coins â€“ often referred to as Liquidity Mining. In short, people who provide liquidity (and stake the
tokens that prove this) get rewarded by receiving more tokens over time, also known as Yield Farming.

## Risk implications

If the coins' prices change, _Divergence Loss_ can occur. This is much less likely when LPing stablecoins, where one can be fairly certain they will stay the same price (eg USDT and USDc).
