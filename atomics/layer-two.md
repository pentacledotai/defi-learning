## What is it? / Why

Blockchain systems offer great technological benefits for money transfers and record-keeping in general;
the main properties most often considered are decentralisation, trust- and permissionlessness, censorship resistance and immutability.

These desired properties of decentralised networks come at the cost of limited throughput, however. Even the most prominent networks of today,
Bitcoin and Ethereum are only able to handle a fairly limited amount of transactions in a given time period; an average BTC transfer takes about 10 minutes,
and some interactions with Ethereum dApps can cost hundreds of dollars during congested times. 

Newer blockchain networks may have somewhat better performance in some aspects, but ultimately all of them suffer from the above tradeoff between speed/accessability and security. Layer 2 refers to solutions to this problem that scale up networks by building a secondary protocol that inherits the security guarantees of the base layer.

secondary protocol on top of a layer one blockchain (eg ethereum)
optimistic rollups, zk rollups () - there are different implementations
processes transactions off of mainnet (as mainnet is slow and expensive)
it's faster (apart from bridging, sometimes) and cheaper

## Types

Scaling solutions to blockchains are an advanced topic with much ongoing research and development. The technical descriptions and differences between each is beyond the scope of this explainer, but they are well worth researching for the curious.

For Bitcoin, the most notable L2 solution is Lightning Network. 

Ethereum has numerous Layer 2 implementations, with the two main approaches being Optimistic Rollups and Zero-Knowledge Rollups.

## Rewards

The main benefit of using Layer 2's is reduced fees and/or improved speed. On top of this, early adapters of new scaling networks can be rewarded by receiving tokens for their bravery from network and app developers, as a bonus.

## Risk implications

---

getting stuck in a bridge with no escape
new technology may be not so robustly tested
ux could be poor and your tokens vanish into a wormhole, with no chance of retrieval (yet) - always do a small test first
may have low volume / liquidity (this could work out well)
